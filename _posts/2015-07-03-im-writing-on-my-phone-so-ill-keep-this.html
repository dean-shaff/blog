<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I'm writing on my phone, so I'll keep this short. My rack broke off my bike outside of Larned, Kansas. I was able to make it into town before the whole thing collapsed on me. The rack itself is intact; there mounts on my bike broke off the seat stays, leaving behind some holes in the aluminum. Good news, REI says they're willing to get me a refund, and I can ride the bike. Bad news is that I can't haul anything.<br /><br />I shipped my stuff to a little town in Missouri. I'm biking to Kansas City with a backpack and a tent. Pictures to come. In spite of everything, I'm having a blast.&nbsp;</div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I made it to Yorktown! I rode the 80 miles from Mechanicsville, super casual, and here I am, chilling by the York river. I biked across the United states! I'll be writing more on the last two days soon. Thank you to the people who have helped make this trip possible. Without my sponsors, and the goodwill of strangers, from members of church communities to people offering me food on the side of the road, I wouldn't have made it this far. Thanks to my dad for driving all over the US to be my support team.&nbsp;</div>

#### Thoughts on the Federalist Papers, 1-5

After talking about my concerns regarding the legitimacy of the US American
system of government with a friend, he recommended that I read the Federalist
Papers in order to get a reasonably accessible introduction to the topic. The
Federalist Papers are a series of essays in defense of the US American
Constitution. So far, I've gotten through the first six essays. Moving forward,
I might skip around a little bit.

##### Essay 1 (Introduction)

- Alexander Hamilton has some pretty great lines in this essay that still feel
poignant today. This whole first part of this essay is essentially
a warning to the US American people, telling them to be careful of people who
attempt to dissuade them from that which is true and right. Check these quotes out:
    - "An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is
    more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as
    mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the
    public good."
    - "[...] the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; [...]
    a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for
    the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the
    firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former
    has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism
    than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of
    republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an
    obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants."


##### Essays 2-5 (Foreign Force and Influence)

- These essays discuss how a unified, strong federal government is superior to
separate state governments, or a set of smaller US confederacies in terms of
protecting common US American interests in the face of foreign influence. In
terms of figuring out what "consent of the governed" means, this section isn't
particularly elucidating. However, I think it does reveal a lot about how some
of the "founding fathers" thought about the form of government they were touting
(representative democracy) and the people that both comprised it and submitted to it.
- It is understood that government is necessary, and that the existence of the
state means that "the people must cede to [the state] some of their natural rights
in order to vest it with requisite powers."
- At the start of essay 2, Jay talks a lot about how the people of the 13 states
are all starting to form a national identity:
    "Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united
     peopleâ€”a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,
     professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government [...]"
Imbued in this, and reinforced later, is a sense that the US American people are
superior to their European or Native American neighbors or counterparts.
- Jay talks a few times about how the best of the best will end up at the
federal level of government. It seems to me that Jay is buying into the whole
notion of a delegate model of representation, where the people trust their candidate
to make good decisions on their behalf.

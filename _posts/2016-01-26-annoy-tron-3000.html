<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I'm currently working on a little project with my buddy Ben. The goal of the project is to make something that will annoy Allen. The electronics we build for this project can definitely be used for other, more potentially profitable purposes I believe. The idea of the project is to embed a temperature sensor, Arduino and buzzer in an 3D printed dildo. By themselves, Arduinos can only generate square waves which are super obnoxious when very high pitched. I envision a typical interaction going as follows. A user will be presented with a screeching dildo. He or she will be told that he or she can only turn it off if they can heat up the dildo past a certain threshold. After furiously heating up the dildo, it will eventually turn off. The interaction here is quite simple, but this project entails an interesting technical challenge. We have to embed an arduino, on/off switch, buzzer, temperature sensor, battery and charging implement in a prosthetic phallus. The on/off switch has to be sufficiently difficult to reach that the user is incentivized to rub the dildo instead of trying to turn it off. We also need to able to charge the battery while still plugged into the Arduino.<br /><br />In future posts I'll put up some pictures so Ben and I can track our progress.&nbsp;</div>

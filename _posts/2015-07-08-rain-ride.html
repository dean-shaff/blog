<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today I set out in the pouring rain. The Katy trail begins. The new bike is sweet, and I'm pumped to get dirty today. I even got my stuff from the post office! I sent home another 7 pounds, and I took some weight out of my bags, so hopefully I won't be breaking anymore bikes.<br /><br />Shout out to REI for hooking me up, and to everyone who has helped get me this far. I couldn't have done this with out the monumental support from friends, my family, and strangers.<br /><br />A long term review of my old bike is in the works! Stay tuned!</div>

I've been wanting to build a radio telescope since I started work at NYUAD two
years ago. For me, radio telescopes have always complicated, buggy collections
of software. You send commands to the antenna control to tell it where to point,
you tell the Front End to do flux calibration, and then you tell the spectrometer
to start collecting data. Eventually, I wrote enough hardware control code that
I could do an end to end observing session with a single Python script --
the telescope was so abstracted away that it came to live in scripts tucked
away on firewall protected servers. Even after visiting the Green Bank
Telescope and the 70m Tidbinbilla telescope outside of Canberra, Australia,
radio telescopes the connection between software and hardware remains a
little vague. I think that two factors contribute to this. This first is my
piecemeal education on the principles of telescopes and their hardware.
The second is that I've never had to chance to play around with an antenna to
see how changing one aspect of the signal chain influences the data that get
collected.

After over a year of dreaming, I've resolved to build my own
radio telescope. I want a playground that I can use to ground my understanding
of antenna theory and digital signal processing. My ultimate goal is to be able
to detect the 22cm Hydrogen line. In order to accomplish this, I'm going to need
a fully steerable, L-band enabled radio antenna. I want to build as much as I
can from scratch, ie not using commerically available science education products.
Moreover, I want to use as much [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
(though not necessarily GPL licensed) software as possible. I don't intend
for this post to be a guide, but it might be useful for that purpose.

### 27/04/2019 - 28/04/2019

Yesterday I bought a 2.5m radio dish. The author of [this guide](https://www.scienceinschool.org/2012/issue23/telescope)
suggested going to scrap yards, but I was able to find one on Facebook
marketplace for $50. I rented a ute (aka pickup truck) and drove about an hour to a
south eastern suburb. I was a little concerned that I wouldn't be able to fit
the dish in the back, but soon after arriving I realized that the antenna can
be broken down pretty easily. With the help of the seller, we were able to
unmount the dish from the metal pole, take off the receiver (mostly) and break
the dish in two. One of the mounts for the receiver was badly rusted, and
without any light or WD40, I wasn't able to get it off. This ended up
helping when the dish was in transport, as I used the receiver to help brace
the dish when strapping it down. I brought some crescent wrenches with me, as
I wasn't sure what the mounting bracket would look like. If
I were to do it again, I would invest in a set of socket wrenches; given the
weird angles and rust, I would have been able to cut the disassembly time in
half.

After dropping some nuts and washers in the grass at the sellers house, I went
to the hardware store today to get some replacement hardware.

Here's the dish before assembly:

And after:

Here I am standing next to the dish, so you can get a sense of how large it is:

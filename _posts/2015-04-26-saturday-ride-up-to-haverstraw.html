<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Yesterday, I took the biggest ride I've taken yet this year, around 80 miles, up to Haverstraw, NY. I thought that I would be doing 100+ mile rides by this time of the year, but I underestimate the amount of psychological and physiological fitness it requires to be in the saddle for even 80 miles. Yesterday was hard, I'll be real. I know that I'm physically capable of riding 80 miles, but I can't help but feel this lingering sense of doubt in the back of my mind that I just won't be able to make it. This sort of thought usually plagues the start of my ride, when I'm in the 2nd quarter of the journey. Luckily, I went out late in the day, so I was mostly alone on the highways, meaning that I could yell and swear and make a big fuss. The scenery absorbs all of my emotions, joy or frustration, and doesn't care. This grand indifference comforts me, and eventually lulls me into a state of flow. Sometimes I don't think about anything when I'm cycling. Waking up today, my legs are super sore, and the prospect of spending another 5 hours on the bike is not at all appealing. As a result, I'll only ride for about 3 hours today, just up to the edge of Palisades State Park.<br /><br />The ride itself was pretty uneventful. I had a bit of a head wind on the way out, and a killer tail wind on the way in, such that between Piermont and the GW bridge I was kicking it pretty hard. I must have been averaging 22 mph! The coolest part of the ride was the discovery of a county bike trail in between Nyack and Piermont. It starts off as an unpaved (packed dirt/gravel) trail and turns into a nicely paved trail for the last 2 miles or so. The gravel was super fun! I was sliding all over the place, while making great time. My 40c tires just mush over everything on the road, so I was cruising along like it was tarmac.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sDEZE_mbFZM/VTz3-aX1EjI/AAAAAAAADl0/KC9pAv2xr04/s1600/IMG_20150425_164151.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sDEZE_mbFZM/VTz3-aX1EjI/AAAAAAAADl0/KC9pAv2xr04/s1600/IMG_20150425_164151.jpg" height="236" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Gravel trail in between Nyack and Piermont. </td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2SUOoDDIayA/VTz3-RnuTEI/AAAAAAAADlw/3coUb2kGoiY/s1600/IMG_20150425_153558.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2SUOoDDIayA/VTz3-RnuTEI/AAAAAAAADlw/3coUb2kGoiY/s1600/IMG_20150425_153558.jpg" height="320" width="236" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sign in Haverstraw, NY indicating that the Hudson reaches its widest point there.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qchdEddAZLg/VTz3-PE3neI/AAAAAAAADls/QXYgKygaquM/s1600/IMG_20150425_163737.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qchdEddAZLg/VTz3-PE3neI/AAAAAAAADls/QXYgKygaquM/s1600/IMG_20150425_163737.jpg" height="236" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Tappan Zee bridge </td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gwchvCZ52ac/VTz3--nzSKI/AAAAAAAADl8/DKn6Qd_Tddc/s1600/PANO_20150425_152938.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gwchvCZ52ac/VTz3--nzSKI/AAAAAAAADl8/DKn6Qd_Tddc/s1600/PANO_20150425_152938.jpg" height="109" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Panorama of the Hudson valley just south of Haverstraw, NY. </td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;</div>

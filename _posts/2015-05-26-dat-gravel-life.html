<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I took the old Schwinn world sport out for a spin today, and I ended up in the Amana colonies, about 30 miles outside of Iowa City. The last 12 miles on the route to Amana is unpaved. In other words, I rode gravel. I grinded the gravel. I ground the gravel, on my gravel grinding Schwinn, with its under-inflated fatty tires, perfect for floating effortlessly over all that gravel. Want proof? Check it out:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2wj7PF-xngw/VWUfCjfDS-I/AAAAAAAAD5M/B3lTZfSK6m8/s1600/PANO_20150526_162941.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="143" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2wj7PF-xngw/VWUfCjfDS-I/AAAAAAAAD5M/B3lTZfSK6m8/s400/PANO_20150526_162941.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Riding on gravel is fun, but like anyone who's ever ridden gravel, I wonder if it necessitates its own category of bike (In reality, I shouldn't even be talking, because I'm riding a gravel bike across the country starting in a few days.). I think I like the name "adventure bike" more than gravel bike. Every time I got on my Diamondback this last semester and turned off on some random unpaved trail, I felt like I was taking an adventure; going some place I would never be able to go on my sexy slice of Cannondale. I got to explore in a way that I'd never explored before, all because my bike could go anywhere and I didn't have to worry about traction or pinch flats or messing up my (heavily discounted) $3200 race bike. Don't get me wrong, I love my Cannondale -- there's nothing quite like the feeling of blasting up a hill at 22 mph -- but having a road bike that can go anywhere is pretty sweet.<br /><br />Today I got muddy, I saw some gorgeous countryside, and I got an entire road all to myself. Gravel's dope.&nbsp;</div>

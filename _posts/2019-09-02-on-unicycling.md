If you've spent any time with me over the last few months, you know that I've
been learning to ride a unicycle. Way back in March or April, I bought a 20"
learning unicycle off Facebook marketplace. I eventually bought a 36" unicycle
with the goal of commuting to work. My workplace is about 10-13km away from home,
depending on the route, making this goal pretty ambitious for a beginner.

It has been a long time since I have learned a completely new skill. Before my
mountain bike was stolen, I was spending lots of time riding off road, which
means learning a whole host of new bike related skills. At work, I've been
learning to code in C++. I've been learning to speak, write and read Hindi.
Each of these things represent learning something new, but each is building
on existing knowledge or using learning skills I've been developing over a long
period of time. With all of these skills, it's hard for me to be aware of myself
learning. Unicycling, on the other hand, is unlike anything else I've ever learned.
With no real frame of reference for riding a uni, I find that I am
hyper aware of the the learning process. It's as if I can feel my brain slowly
rewiring itself. With enough repitition, I learn to make the tiny adjustments
necessary to balance not only side to side, but also fore and aft. Many of
the narratives I hear with regards to learning new skills involve some "aha" moment,
or something finally clicking into place. This has not been my experience.
Learning to unicycle has been a slow, sometimes excrutiating process, characterized
by incremental, fleeting improvements that fall away almost
as fast as they come. Eventually, with time, these improvements stick. I'm now
at the point where I can reliably (almost everytime) free mount my 36er, and I
can do about 15km in one ride. I think I'll be ready to ride to work in the
next few weeks.

I estimate that I spent three to five hours getting to the point where I could
ride the 20" uni more than about five meters. Two schools of thought exist
with regards to learning to ride a unicycle. The first comprises riding along
very close to a wall, using it for support in case one starts to fall to the
side. The second involves using the wall to mount, and then attempting to ride
away, unsupported. I took the latter approach, because I didn't want to fall
into the habit of using the wall as a crutch. The 20" uni is small enough that
I could simply step off of it if I started to fall, meaning that I wasn't too
worried about falling on my bum due to the uni slipping out from under me.

Once I learned to ride the uni around that parking area of my apartment block, I
endevoured to learn how to free mount. This means getting on the unicycle without
any external support. This proved almost as difficult as learning to ride in the
first place! Learning to free mount taught me that acquiring any new unicycle
related skill takes a lot of time and patience. At one point I stopped riding
for over a month because I was so discouraged by my lack of progress with the
free mount. Eventually, after trying and failing hundreds of times, I succeeded
in getting on and riding away. With a few more hours of practice, I was able to
pretty reliably free mount. I felt that I was ready for a bigger and better uni.

I ended up buying a KH 36 unicycle. This represents a significant upgrade over
my learning uni. The KH has a giant 36" wheel, a hydraulic disc brake, a top of
the line saddle, and a pretty blue aluminum frame. Wheel size, in the land of
unicycles, is like bike gears. Given that the pedals are fixed to the wheel, each
pedal rotation equates to a single rotation of the wheel. A larger wheel means
that one can ride further with a single pedal rotation. The 36er is roughly 1.8
times larger in circumference than the 20", meaning that I can cover much
more ground in the same number of pedal strokes. I figure that I could get to the
point where I would average about 15 km/h on the 36er, meaning that I could
get to work in less than an hour. For distance road riding, the 36er is the only
way to go. Another interesting aspect of unicycles is the fact that the cranks
are far shorter than those found on bicycles. My 36er comes drilled with two
pedal positions, one at 150mm, and one at 127mm. Compare this to the 175mm cranks
on my commuter bike. Shorter cranks allow one to pedal faster more comfortably,
as the foot is not making as big of a circle as on longer cranks. With 127mm
cranks, I might expect to get up to 180 rpm, which would be nigh inconceivable
on a bicycle.

Moving from the 20" to the 36er was much trickier than I anticipated. At first,
the size of the wheel was super intimidating, as it puts the saddle several
centimeters above my navel when I stand next to the uni. Unlike the 20", I could
not step off the uni, I could only _fall_ off. Moreover, given the increased size,
it takes significantly more effort to get the unicycle moving. For the first
few days of riding it, I struggled to get it moving even with the help of the
wall. Once I was reliably able to get it moving, I was entranced. Riding the
36er incites a feeling of exhileration of the type I haven't experienced before.
The sensation of riding a unicycle is more like walking than that of riding a
bicycle. Unicycling, like walking, is an exercise in controlled falling. The
pedals serve to conteract this falling, in the same way that the heel of the leading
foot prevents one from falling when walking. The height of the 36er is almost
reminiscent of riding a tall bike -- when riding down the Capital City Trail in
Melbourne I tower over everyone else on the trail. The 36er is also remarkably
quiet. Without a chain, brakes (I removed the disc brake for the purposes of learning),
or steering mechanism, the uni doesn't really have anything to make noise. On
quiet sections of the trail, I'm greeted only by the rythmic slap of the tire
against the ground and my breath.

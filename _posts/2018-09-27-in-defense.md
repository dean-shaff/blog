#### In Defense of Anarchism

Last summer I read _In Defense of Anarchism_ by Robert Paul Wolff and I've
been thinking a lot about the way we go about government in my home country, the
United States of America. Here are some compelling ideas and questions that Wolff
presents:

- Autonomy vs authority, which Wolff presents this as the central tension of
any form of government.
    - Autonomy is "self legislation", or the ability to live by our own moral
    code or set of values. This doesn't mean that we can't listen to or take advice from others;
    so long as we don't act _because someone told us to_ we can act in accordance
    with what others believe.
    - Authority is how the state derives legitimacy in order to compel us to
    act in certain ways. Wolff draws a distinction between authority and power.
    Power does not imply authority. One can have power over another and exercise it,
    but it does not mean that that power is justified. Power coupled with the
    [right to use it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority) is authority.
    - Authority and autonomy are fundamentally at odds, as authority requires
    us to act out of obligation, often in ways that compromise our own moral code.
    - Wolff points out that we can submit to a punishment and still preserve our autonomy. However,
    we cannot, in a blanket manner, agree to submit to punishments for a set of
    unspecified future criminal actions. We exercise our autonomy with every
    action we take, this we cannot maintain autonomy by agreeing to compromise
    our moral code in the future.
- How does representative democracy preserve our autonomy?
    - Legislative bodies often pass laws that compel us to act (or not act) in
    ways that defy our own set of values. Say, for example, that I do not believe
    that I should have to pay taxes. By paying these taxes, I am submitting to
    the authority of the state and compromising my autonomy. Note that this
    is different from not wanting to pay taxes, but doing so because I think
    it is a socially good thing to do.
    - Representative democracy is setup in a way such that we are forced to
    give up our autonomy. As we exercise autonomy on a decision by decision
    basis, agreeing to let a group of people make _n_ future decisions on our behalf
    (some in accordance with our moral code, some not) compromises our
    autonomy, even if we willingly elected legislators in the first place.     
    <!-- Representative democracy has democratic moments, such as when
    we elect candidates to represent us, or when we vote on a referendum.  -->
- Is direct democracy possible in 2018? If everyone had a smartphone, why can't
everyone vote on every bill at every level of government?
- Why are we so convinced of the legitimacy of majority rule? If 50.1% percent
of a group vote in favor of something, a non trivial amount of people (49.9% no less!)
are are losing out.

I've spent some time talking about ideas with people, especially fellow US
Americans. One of the things that surprises me the most is how resistant people
are to the idea of direct democracy. Many objections come down to the following:

*"How could we trust the common person with the job of making laws?"*

Common people are either too busy, too uninformed, too inexperienced, or too
stupid to be entrusted with the job of making laws. Hearing the systems of
government present in the USA described as democratic makes me wonder what
we (as US Americans) mean when we say "democracy". The phrase "consent of the
governed" comes to mind. How is this consent granted? Do we do it every time we
vote, or do we grant it implicitly by being a citizen? Either way, how can we
preserve our autonomy when we surrender our ability to make decisions according
to our own system of values in a such a blanket fashion?

Here's a few things I want to read in order to clarify what this means:

- The Federalist Papers
- _A History of Political Theory_ by George Sabine, especially bits about David
Hume
- The United States Declaration of Independence
- _Essay Concering Human Understanding_ by John Locke
- _On Liberty_ by John Stuart Mill

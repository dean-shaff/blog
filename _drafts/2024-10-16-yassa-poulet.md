I've been making this wonderful Senegalese dish called Yassa Poulet with my partner over the past few months. It's very tasty, and I think I've gotten the recipe to the point where I'm ready to write up a hyperlocal recipe. Lately I've been on a quest to make my food as oumami packed as possible, so I've included some very non-traditional additions to this recipe that really deepen the flavour. Feel free to omit them, but I think they take this dish from really good to compulsively delicious. I like to make several extra servings when I prepare this dish so I can eat it throughout the week. 

Makes 4 servings

### Ingredients 

- 4 bone-in chicken thighs, optionally with skin on[^skin]
- 6 big white or yellow onions[^onions]
- 300mL jar of green olives, brine included 
- 


[^skin] The skin will be crispy when it comes out of the oven, but it won't stay that way if you keep it in the fridge. I've come to really enjoy the slightly rubbery, chewy texture of non-crispy chicken skin, but I know that others really can't stand that feeling in their mouth. 
[^onions] The sauce for this dish comprises mostly caramelized onions, so I like to do one to one and a half big onions per serving. By big, I mean those onions that make you wonder if genetic modification was involved in the cultivation.

- Introdution - what got me thinking about all this?
  - Wikipedia calls Hindi and Urdu two registers of the same language, Hindustani.
  - In practice, some people seem to talk about them as two distinct languages.
    - The way people talk about Hindi and Urdu seems different to the way people talk about dialects of the same language. When people talk about accents in Portuguese, there is no question that they're speaking the same language.
  - Is what I'm encountering here the distinction between a socio-cultural definition of a language versus the linguistics definition of a language?
  - I can't tell to what degree people who identify as a speaker of one or the other are imposing the idea that Urdu and Hindi are different languages. In reality, they can be *very* similar. Sometimes I'll joke with my girlfriend that I spoke Urdu today. When she asks how I know, I'll say that I greeted someone with "assalaam alaikum".
  - All this got me thinking about the historical development of the two languages.

- Questions about the history of what we call Hindi:
  - How long have people been using the word "Hindi"?
  - How long have people been writing Hindustani in Devanagari?
  - How many of the words in common use in the Hindi register of Hindustani were introduced as part of some official (ie state sponsored) effort to Sanskritize the language?
    - When did this Sanskritization happen, and how?
  - Have there been similar efforts to reinforce a Persianized lexicon?
  - If I were to go back to 1850, what would the geographic distribution of Hindustani look like? If I went to the mountains of the contemporary state of Uttarakhand, would I find Hindi speakers beyond travelers?
    - My understanding is that Urdu was very much a prestige language used by upper class members of Mughal Society.
    - Have their been official efforts to promulgate Hindi in India and Urdu in Pakistan?
  - When did the Hindi/Urdu split occur? Can we narrow it down to a specific year, or did it take place over many years?
  - To what degree does geopolitical tension between Pakistan and India reinforce the discretization of Hindi and Urdu? (In reality, people rarely use an entirely Sanksritized or Persianized lexicon when speaking Hindustani)

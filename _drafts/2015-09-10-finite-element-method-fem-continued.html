<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I want to talk about the process of discretizing the Poisson problem we started in my last post. Last time we ended with the weak form of the Poisson equation, of the following form.<br />$$<br />\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v\: da = \int_{\Omega} f v \: da<br />$$<br />The basic idea of finite element method is that we grab hold of a set of basis functions and say that u is a linear combination of these functions. I'll discuss the particular form of these basis functions in a sec, but first lets cast $u$ as a linear combination of basis functions $\phi_i$.<br />$$<br />u(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^N u_i \phi_i<br />$$<br /><br /><br />Note that unless we have an unlimited number of these functions, we'll be approximating $u$. $N$ is the total number of basis functions we use to approximate our solution. In order to form these basis functions, we must first discretize our domain. Let's say for the sake of argument that we're working on a rectangular domain (I know I said that FEM is cool because it works on irregular shaped domains, but let's just put that aside for hot sec). We first choose a shape that we want to use for discretizing the domain. In my code, I use triangles, but one can use other shapes. We then break up the domain into little triangles. For example, let's say we're using a square grid, where $x \in [0,5]$ and $ y \in [0,5]$. Our triangulation would look as follows.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div>In my code, each of these triangles is defined as a set of 3 coordinates. Each point in the domain is either classified as being on the boundary or not. The points not on the boundary are 'nodes.' With these triangles and nodes in hand, we can define our basis functions. For each node in the domain, we define the following function.<br />$$<br />f(x)=x<br />$$</div><div>In other words, the $i^{th}$ basis function is zero on every node except for the $i^{th}$ one. $x$ $$f(x)=x^2<br />$$<br />The basis functions must also obey the boundary conditions defined for the problem. Remember that each node is connected to its adjacent nodes by triangles. This means that for every triangle that makes up a basis function, we can define the following function.</div><div>$$</div><div>f(x,y)_{h,i} = \alpha + \beta x + \gamma y</div><div>$$<br />Here, h indicates that we're talking about the $h^{th}$ triangle for the $i^{th}$ basis function. In the case of the discretized grid I showed above, each basis function is comprised of six of these piece-wise linear functions. Note that this will not always be the case.<br />In the weak form of the Poisson function, we have some arbitrary function $v$ that we've yet to define. Now let's do it. Let's say that $v$ is just $\phi_i$.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

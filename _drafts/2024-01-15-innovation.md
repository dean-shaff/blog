I've been thinking a lot about innovation over the past few weeks.

- A lot of innovation is narrow-minded. How? 
- Innovative ideas solve existing problems but often create a whole host of new problems. The automobile, Facebook. We are obsessed with innovation, sometimes just for the sake of innovation. We love to laud the shining beacons of 19th, 20th and 21st century innovation without giving scarecly a nod in the direction of all the suffering those innovations have caused. 
    - Steam engine. How many deaths worldwide has burning coal been responsible for over the last 200 years?
    - Car. How many deaths worldwide has burning gasoline (some of if laden with lead) has been responsible for? 

Here I'm just talking about the direct effects of these innovations, without even considering the knock-on effects. The steam engine was the powerhouse of the industrial revolution, whose factories and mechanization brought about huge levels of suffering on the part of the everyday worker. 

My issue here is not so much innovation, but rather innovation coupled with a capitalist incentive system. I'm not saying that the steam engine was a bad idea. In fact it's a pretty cool idea, and allows for automating lots of work that was previously back-breaking for either humans or animals. What I take issue with is the fact that when you're stuck in a system where your bottom line is the only thing you care about, there is no incentive to stop, take a breath, and ask what sort of negative knock-on effects your innovation is having. This is especially exacerbated when things like regulation are seen as "hampering business" instead of "protecting the basic rights of humans and the environment".

We invent electricity. More people can have on-demand lighting after dark. This is unprecedented in human history. What does all that extra light mean? Ideally it would make reading, cooking, cleaning, or socializing after dark a lot easier. I imagine for a lot of people what it meant was factories being open 24 hours a day. In a capitalist world there is no such thing is a labour saving device. There are only labour-replacing devices. 

What are good innovations? 

- systemized hybridization of plants 
- vaccines
- antibiotics
- municipal water filtration and sewer systems
- The Internet
- The computer 

I can't even make a broad statement like "innovation under capitalism sucks". More correct would be to say "innovation under capitalism is a total wild card whose knock-on effects could mean that a whole generation of youth grow up more anxious and depressed as compared to the previous generation (social media) or the end of civilization as we know it (the steam engine)." We're at a point where we simply cannot afford to "move fast and break things". To be honest, we've never been in that place. Let's stop calling innovation as currently see it innovation. Let's call it what it is: smart people acting like dumbasses. 

- Innovative and disruptive ideas put people out of work. I have often conceived of this is as inevitable or necessary. Maybe that's true, but it doesn't also have to be unethical. Consider all the people that digital printing put out of work in the 1990s. People trained in highly specialized occupations that suddenly found themselves out of work. This is a huge hit to one's sense of self. Imagine having trained for years to do a job that became redundant within the space of 5 years. More important than this psychological toll is the fact that people no longer have work. We live in a world where you cannot eat, live or in some places, have access to healthcare without working. We sentenced thousands of highly trained professionals to death by exposure of hunger just so we could have sharper images in our magazines. The common refrain here is that these professionals should retrain in a new field, adapt their existing skills to the new paradigm, or simply get a job elsewhere. While I consider this to be an incredibly unempathetic standpoint, I could almost stand by it if there weren't so much at stake.

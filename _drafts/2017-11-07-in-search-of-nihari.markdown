Sometime last year, one of my friends introduced me to nihari. Nihari is a
Pakistani stew made with beef or mutton. It is fatty, rich, heavily spiced,
and quite delicious. I have had nihari where there mutton is so tender
and succulent that it seems to have disintegrated into the stew. Nihari is
eaten with giant pieces of flat bread that I hesitate to call roti. I think
a lot of the restaurants in Abu Dhabi that serve nihari either bake the bread
on premise, or get them from a nearby bakery. For those not familiar with
Abu Dhabi's makhaabiz (مجابز), or bakeries, they are a really cool aspect of
the city's street life. I say مجابز because many of these places won't
advertise their name in English, and because I'm trying to practice typing
in Arabic. For those interested in the history of typesetting in Arabic (I am),
I found [this]() (rather long) article. Anyways, these bakeries sell 1 dirham
pieces of freshly baked bread that are
large enough to park a Nissan Patrol in. 

 A popular
variation is nihari with _mughuz_, or brains.

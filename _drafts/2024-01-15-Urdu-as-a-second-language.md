When I first moved to Abu Dhabi in 2012, I was fascinated by how immensely cosmopolitan the city was. Abu Dhabi is cosmopolitan in a way that's hard to understand unless you've lived somewhere like Brooklyn. I live in 



I got back from a trip to the UAE last Thursday. I was there to see my friend get married, and it was a lovely wedding. We danced until we were dripping with sweat and then kept dancing. We danced harder than I've danced in years. It reminded me of all the partying that Kim Stanley Robinson talks about in his Mars Trilogy (I just finished those books a day or so ago so its very fresh in my mind). 

My friend planned some wedding activities before the ceremony itself, but we had a lot of downtime to explore Dubai. 

I haven't been back to the UAE in over five years, so I was really excited at the chance to wander around old Dubai and downtown Abu Dhabi with my best friend from university.

Being back in Deira reminded me of one the reasons why I wanted to learn Urdu in the first place. 

I had the chance to 

- I learned Urdu in the first place because I wanted to be able to talk to people in the UAE. Depending on where you go in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Urdu is the lingua franca.
- I found myself speaking Urdu to the following people:
    - Afghanistanis and Pakistanis whose first langauge is Pashto.
    - Pakistanis whose first language is Punjabi, but speak Urdu more or less natively. 
    - Indians and Bangladeshis whose first language is Bengali
    - Indians whose first language is Malayalam
    - Sometimes I would interact with native Bengali-speakers or Dari-speakers in the _same business_ and use Urdu to communicate. 
- I was able to follow through on one of my initial motivations for learning Urdu in the first place; to be able to connect more deeply with the people I meet in the UAE. Most of the people I interacted with had a passing knowledge of English, but their Urdu was far more advanced, meaning that we could have much more meaningful conversations when speaking in Urdu. I learned little snippets from peoples' lives that I would never have been able to learn had I been speaking to them in English.
- Something interesting occurs when you put a group of people together wherein no one is speaking their native language. With no native speaker in the room, all the pressure is off. No one has to worry about making tons of mistakes so long as you're understood. I think this has the potential to create an atmosphere of collaboration because for a brief moment language becomes a tool not an identity. I think this experience is common for many people (including most of my colleagues at work as soon as I leave the room) but as a native English speaker I don't experience it a lot.

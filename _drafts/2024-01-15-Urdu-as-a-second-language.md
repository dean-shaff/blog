Hindi/Urdu as a common second (or third) language.

I recently traveled back to the UAE for a friend's wedding. This is the first time I'd been back in over five years, and also the first time that I'd been back since starting to speak some Hindi/Urdu. Part of my initial motivation for learning Urdu 

- I learned Urdu in the first place because I wanted to be able to talk to people in the UAE. Depending on where you go in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Urdu is the lingua franca.
- I found myself speaking Urdu to the following people:
    - Afghanistanis and Pakistanis whose first langauge is Pashto.
    - Pakistanis whose first language is Punjabi, but speak Urdu more or less natively. 
    - Indians and Bangladeshis whose first language is Bengali
    - Indians whose first language is Malayalam
    - Sometimes I would interact with native Bengali-speakers or Dari-speakers in the _same business_ and use Urdu to communicate. 
- I was able to follow through on one of my initial motivations for learning Urdu in the first place; to be able to connect more deeply with the people I meet in the UAE. Most of the people I interacted with had a passing knowledge of English, but their Urdu was far more advanced, meaning that we could have much more meaningful conversations when speaking in Urdu. I learned little snippets from peoples' lives that I would never have been able to learn had I been speaking to them in English.
- Something interesting occurs when you put a group of people together wherein no one is speaking their native language. With no native speaker in the room, all the pressure is off. No one has to worry about making tons of mistakes so long as you're understood. I think this has the potential to create an atmosphere of collaboration because for a brief moment language becomes a tool not an identity. I think this experience is common for many people (including most of my colleagues at work as soon as I leave the room) but as a native English speaker I don't experience it a lot.
